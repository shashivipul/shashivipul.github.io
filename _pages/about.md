Namaste! I am **Vipul**, an AI researcher working on trustworthiness and scalability challenges in **Graph Machine Learning**, with a particular focus on fairness and robustness. I am currently a fifth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in). My research is advised by [Prof. Sandeep Kumar](https://sites.google.com/view/sandeepkr/home) and [Prof. Jayadeva](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~jayadeva/) at the [Machine Intelligence Signals and Networks (MISN) Lab](https://misn.iitd.ac.in). I am incredibly grateful and excited to mention that I have received the prestigious [Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF)](https://www.pmrf.in) as part of my PhD journey.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my **M.Tech.** in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in), where I worked on biomedical signal and image processing under the supervision of [Prof. Maheshkumar H. Kolekar](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~mahesh/). I earned my **B.Tech.** in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU)](https://aktu.ac.in).
