Namaste! I am **Vipul**, an AI researcher working on trustworthiness and scalability challenges in **Graph Machine Learning**, with a particular focus on fairness and robustness. I am currently a fifth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in). My research is advised by [Prof. Sandeep Kumar](https://sites.google.com/view/sandeepkr/home) and [Prof. Jayadeva](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~jayadeva/) at the [Machine Intelligence Signals and Networks (MISN) Lab](https://misn.iitd.ac.in). I am grateful that my doctoral research is supported by the [Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship](https://www.pmrf.in).
